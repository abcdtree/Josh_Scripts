## CC_20220201_2_Serratia_marcescens_No_scheme & CC_20220208_Serratia_marcescens_No_scheme

### Question:

Are the focal isolate/s listed above closely related to each other and/or to any previous isolates of this species, ST and gene combination?

### Focus Isolates:

2022-019411
2022-019412
2022-012251

### Analysis:
First, I used all Serratia Marcescens (species as Serratia Marcescens) isolates to run a mashtree analysis to short list the isolates for each focus isolates.

After that, I created 3 groups of isolates in each of which contains one focus isolates. *(The distance between the focus isolates are large enough to support that they are not likely related to each other)*

Then, for each group of isolates, I ran a bohra analysis with the de novo assembly contigs of the focus isolate as reference.

### Results:

1. 2022-019411:
42 isolates were included in this analysis.
And 2021-043706 is highly related to the focus isolate. And there are several isolates including 2020-07189, 2018-17526 and .. which are possibly related to the focus isolate `2022-019411`.

2. 2022-019412:
91 isolates were included in this analysis.
And There are 3 isolates results smaller snp distance even than the de novo assembly reference. They are 2022-019412, 2021-046182, and 2021-044968.
Other isolates in the analysis list are not likely related to the focus isolates.

3. 2022-012251:
22 isolates were included in this analysis.
And I think all isolates are not likely related to the focus isolate.
