## CC_20220301_1_Klebsiella_pneumoniae_ST17

### Focus isolate(s):
2022-028849<br>
2022-031428

### Question
Is/are the focus isolate(s) listed above closely related to each other and/or any previous isolates of this species, ST and gene combination?

### Analysis:
Two bohra runs:<br>
1. Using reference `NZ_CP026157.1 Klebsiella pneumoniae strain F93-2 chromosome, complete genome`, the link is https://bioinformatics.mdu.unimelb.edu.au/~jianszhang/MDU/kpneumoniae/ST17/report3.html

2. Using de novo assembly contigs of `2022-028849` as reference, the link is https://bioinformatics.mdu.unimelb.edu.au/~jianszhang/MDU/kpneumoniae/ST17/report4.html

### Conclusion:
I found a cluster of isolates that are highly related to the focus isolates, including:<br>
2022-030709<br>
2022-030720<br>
2020-26913<br>
2021-162405<br>
2021-056279<br>
2020-25097<br>
2021-096838<br>
2021-188593<br>
2021-007111<br>

The other isolates are not likely related to the focus isolates.
