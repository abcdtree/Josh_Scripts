## CC_22022022_1_Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_ST235

### Focus isolate(s):

2022-026323
2021-143655

### Question:

Is/are the focus isolate(s) listed above closely related to each other and/or any previous isolates of this species, ST and gene combination?

### Analysis:
I have run 3 bohra analysis.

First one, I used `NZ_CP033833.1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain FDAARGOS_571 chromosome, complete genome` as reference. The report link is https://bioinformatics.mdu.unimelb.edu.au/~jianszhang/MDU/paeruginosa/ST235/report.html

Second one, I used de novo assembly of `2022-026323` as reference. The report link is https://bioinformatics.mdu.unimelb.edu.au/~jianszhang/MDU/paeruginosa/ST235/report3.html

Third one, I used de novo assembly of `2021-143655` as reference. The report link is https://bioinformatics.mdu.unimelb.edu.au/~jianszhang/MDU/paeruginosa/ST235/report4.html

### Conclusion:
From the 3 analysis above, I found out:
1. Even with the de novo assembly reference, the snp distance between isolate with the reference is not ideal. The focus isolate has a snp distance bigger than 30 to the its assembly.
2. Luckily, the references do not change the relationship. So from the 3 runs we could discover that
For `2022-026323`, there are several isolates that are likely related to it, such as 2018-16581, 2020-27823, 2019-23377 and 2021-003036.

For `2021-143655`, similarly, there are several isolates that are likely related to it, such as 2019-23377, 2020-64779, 2018-23016 and 2019-28828.

While the snp distance is not very trustable in numbers while the reference distance is even larger to itself, I hope the reletionship I provide to you could match some epi links.
